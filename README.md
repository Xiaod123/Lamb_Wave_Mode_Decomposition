# Lamb Wave Mode Decomposition Using Concentric Ring and Circular Piezoelectric Transducers

![](post/overview.jpg)

## Description
Lamb waves using surface-bonded piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) have been widely used for nondestructive testing (NDT). However, the identification of individual Lamb wave modes and the subsequent data interpretation are often difficult due to the dispersive and multimodal natures of Lamb waves. To tackle the problem, a Lamb wave mode decomposition technique using concentric ring and circular PZTs is proposed. Its advantages over the conventional approaches are that (1) PZTs need to be placed only a single surface of a specimen and (2) mode decomposition can be performed at any desired frequency without changing the PZT size and/or spacing configuration. The proposed mode decomposition technique is formulated by solving 3D Lamb wave propagation equations considering the PZT size and shape, and this technique requires a specially designed dual PZT composed of concentric ring and circular PZTs. The effectiveness of the proposed technique for the Lamb wave mode decomposition is investigated through numerical simulation and experimental tests performed on an aluminum plate. Keywords:

## Sample Results (Numerical Simulation)

### Configuration of the numerical simulation
> ** The goal is to decompose the S0 and A0 mode in the signal obtained from Path AB. The normalized scaling factors are obtained from theoretical solutions. PZT C is only used for the validation of the proposed method and not needed for its actual implementation.**

## Sample Results (Experiment)

### Configuration of the experiment
> ** The goal is to decompose the S0 and A0 mode in the signal obtained from Path AB. The normalized scaling factors are obtained from path AD because the S0 and A0 modes have enough separation to compute them. PZT C is only used for the validation of the proposed method and not needed for its actual implementation.**

### Comparison of the normalized scaling factor obtained from paths AB and AD

> **The normalized scaling factors in the path AD are in good agreement with those in the path AB. In theory, the normalized scaling factors must be identical regardless of length of paths as long as the sizes of the dual PZTs are identical and the plate is homogeneous. Thus, the S0 and A0 modes in the path AB can be decomposed using the normalized scaling factors obtained from the path AD.**

### Comparison of the normalized scaling factor obtained from FEM simulation and theoretical solutions

> ** The result shows that the decomposed S0 and A0 modes are in a good agreement with the selectively generated S0 and A0 modes signals. Even the first and/or second reflections of the S0 and A0 modes can be effectively extracted from the measured signals.**
